# STARFIELD

## INTRODUCTION

StarField is my own personal interpretation of the #1GAM theme, which for March 2016 was set to ARENA.

Made during #1GAM March 2016 gamejam.

## GAME STATUS

This is an early prototype, presenting the core game-play and mechanics.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Shoot and destroy any enemy ship and survive.

Straight simple.

Use the arrow keys to rotates the player ship. Press the X to shoot.

## TOOLS

The game uses the [LOVE](http://love2d.org) game engine.

Sounds have been generated with [Bfxr](www.bfxr.net).
